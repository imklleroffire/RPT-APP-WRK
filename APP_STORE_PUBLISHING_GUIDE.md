- You'll get an email when it's done
- Download the `.ipa` file (or use direct EAS submission)

---

### **STEP 5: Submit to App Store** (30 minutes)

```bash
eas submit --platform ios --latest
```
- Automatically uploads to App Store Connect

## üì± REQUIRED SCREENSHOTS GUIDE

### How to Take Screenshots:

1. **Using iOS Simulator** (on Mac):
   ```bash
   npx expo start --ios
   # Cmd + S in simulator to save screenshot
   ```

2. **Using Physical iPhone**:
   - Run on your device
   - Take screenshots (Volume Up + Power button)
   - AirDrop to Mac

3. **Use Screenshot Tools**:
   - [Screenshot.rocks](https://screenshot.rocks/) - Add device frames
   - [Mockuphone](https://mockuphone.com/) - Professional mockups

### Screenshots to Take (minimum):
1. **Therapist Dashboard** - Shows patient management
2. **Exercise Bundle View** - Shows exercise creation
3. **Patient Streak Calendar** - Shows progress tracking
4. **Notifications** - Shows therapist/patient connection
5. **Settings/Profile** - Shows app polish

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

1. **Hardcoded Firebase Keys**: 
   - ‚úÖ Already handled in your config

2. **Missing Test Account**:
   - Apple reviewers need a demo account
   - **ACTION**: Create `testtherapist@rptapp.com` and `testpatient@rptapp.com`
   - Add credentials in App Store Connect under "App Review Information"

3. **App Crashes on First Launch**:
   - Test in production mode before submitting
   - **ACTION**: Run `eas build --profile production` and test on physical device

4. **Missing Functionality**:
   - All features shown in screenshots must work
   - **ACTION**: Remove any unfinished features or hide them

5. **Wrong Bundle Identifier**:
   - ‚úÖ Already correct: `com.amtkumar.rptapp`
   - Must match App Store Connect exactly
